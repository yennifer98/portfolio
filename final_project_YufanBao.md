**Target Audience:**  
People who are interested in starting a new business, and people who are already in the stage of generating idea for their startups

**Call to Action:**  
Choose a field that investors are fond of to get the funding for your startup successfully! A successful start is always a necessary step for future success!

**Progress form Part II:**  
My first progress is to fix the overall logic. As for Part II, I got a feedback that it seems some logic is missing in between the graphs of my story. Therefore, to fix this problem, I begin with writing the presentation manuscript for my story, and try to read it aloud to see what is the logic flaw. Then I figured out that after I discuss about the fact that 90% of startups failed, I jumped into two more facts about startup fundings directly. However, after the discussion about the startup failure, a spontaneous question is: what's the reasons for these failures? Therefore, I did research on this topic and search for the corresponding data. I added a new tree graph to talk about the reason. Then I will say I want to focus on one of the main problem: finance problem, to connect the part of startup failure and the part of lack of funding together. After the discussion about lack of funding, the next step logic is: thus these startups seem to have financial problem at the initial stage! (gathering funding stage). Therefore, it's important to get funding successfully to make sure you will have future success. Finally, I will end with my call to action mentioned above. Then the logic for my story is complete and easy to understand now.
