Previous Progress:

Final Presentation Deliverable (on the Shorthand Platform):

**Target Audience:**  
People who are interested in starting a new business, and people who are already in the stage of generating idea for their startups  
Changes made with the audience in mind: Before I give my story, the audience would never expect the up to 90% of startups failed in this year. This is really a large percentage. Therefore, if the audience still want to startup, they will be more careful about how to make sure their startup won't fail. Then I talked about the funding patterns. I believe after my presentation, the audience will think twice before they make the decision on choosing the field of their startups.

**Call to Action:**  
Choose a field that investors are fond of to get the funding for your startup successfully! A successful start is always a necessary step for future success!

**Progress form Part II:**  
My first progress is to fix the overall logic. As for Part II, I got a feedback that it seems some logic is missing in between the graphs of my story. Therefore, to fix this problem, I begin with writing the presentation manuscript for my story, and try to read it aloud to see what is the logic flaw. Then I figured out that after I discuss about the fact that 90% of startups failed, I jumped into two more facts about startup fundings directly. However, after the discussion about the startup failure, a spontaneous question is: what's the reasons for these failures? Therefore, I did research on this topic and search for the corresponding data. I added a new tree graph to talk about the reason. Then I will say I want to focus on one of the main problem: finance problem, to connect the part of startup failure and the part of lack of funding together. After the discussion about lack of funding, the next step logic is: thus these startups seem to have financial problem at the initial stage! (gathering funding stage). Therefore, it's important to get funding successfully to make sure you will have future success. Finally, I will end with my call to action mentioned above. Then the logic for my story is complete and easy to understand now.  
The second change is the color change of my fisrt graph. Here I want to focus on the failure part, but the color is reversed to focus on the other part. Therefore, I reverse the color to make the graph more reasonable.  
The third change I made is to add some short texts between the sections to make sure the audience can understand my story.  
My last change is to add the call to action text at the end of the storyboard to let the audience know what I want them to bring home.
