# Final Project Part I
## Outline
Overall, the purpose of this project is to study how startups receive fundings. To be more specific, I wish to draw conclusions on two fronts.

Firstly, I hope to figure out what types of startups (startups in what kind of fields) are most likely to receive funding, and what kind of startups are likely to receive the most amount of funding. In other words, I want to understand the relationship between the fields of startups and the funding amount so as to find out which fields are most popular within sponsors.

Secondly, I'm also curious about which cities are the start-up companies receiving funding located in. Maybe this result can tell me what kind of cities do entrepreneurs like to gather in.

## The Data
The dataset I'm going to use is a small dataset posted on Kaggle but has no analysis yet, and the link is:
[Link to the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/startups-funding-rounds?select=sf.csv)

I'm going to use the column "IndustryVertical", "SubVertical" and "AmountInUSD" to study the relationship between the type of startups and the funding amount. Next, I'm going to use the column "CityLocation" to study the locations of startups.

## Method and Medium
I'm going to use Shorthand to build my story.
