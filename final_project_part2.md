# Final Project Part II

## Wireframes and Storyboards
I use the Shorthand to design the wireframe. Here is the [link](https://preview.shorthand.com/XBwWs2kIClpHAzgz).

## User Reasearch Protocal
The target audience: people who may interested in starting a startup / new business; people who want to have a general idea about what is current startups doing.
Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview: I want to hear feedback from people form different ages. Also, I want to find a people who want to start a new business recently. Therefore, my three targets are: 1 middle age people, 1 young student who is not interested in starting a startup, 1 young student who is interested in starting a startup.
Interview Script:
