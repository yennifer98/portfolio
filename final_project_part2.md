# Final Project Part II

## Wireframes and Storyboards
I use the Shorthand to design the wireframe. Here is the [link](https://preview.shorthand.com/XBwWs2kIClpHAzgz).

## User Reasearch Protocal
**The target audience**: people who may interested in starting a startup / new business; people who want to have a general idea about what is current startups doing.
**Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview**: I want to hear feedback from people form different ages. Also, I want to find a people who want to start a new business recently. Therefore, my three targets are: 1 middle age people, 1 young student who is not interested in starting a startup, 1 young student who is interested in starting a startup.
**Interview Script**:

|                                       **Question**                                      |                                      **Intent**                                      |

| Have you ever thought about starting your own business?                                 | To figure out the current audience type                                              |
| If so, have you thought about any implementation details? Could you share that with me? | To know about the audience's basic idea about starting a startup                     |
| Begin to show my fisrt version of storyboard...                                         |                                                                                      |
| What's the main information you get from my pre? Is it valuable?                        | See whether my story can help the audience get the main information I want to convey |
| Do you think the visualiaztions are good enough?                                        | To get feedback on how to improve my visualization                                   |
| Anything you want to further know about? Or what info do you want me to add?            | To see is there anything I can add                                                   |

## User Research Fundings
Adult, mid 30â€™s:
This people has no interets in starting a startup. "It's hard to believe that so many startups failed in this year. The reason of lacking funding makes sense to me. However, is the lacking of funding due to the recession? I'm a little bit curious what's the condition for last five years."

Student, mid 20's:
"For the last visualization, it could be better to shorter the values listed on y-axis."
"Another thing is, I feel the content is not enough, like, can we draw some further conclusion? Shall we just stop by the choice of fields?"

Student, mid 20's (interested in starting a startup):
"The suggestion on choosing a popular field doesn't make sense to me. How do you know if the industry is already saturated? If it is, then choosing the most populst field can be a bad choice."

## Next steps for Part III
1. Consider adding a visualization that to figure out what's the effect of recession compared to the lack of funding.
2. Fix the last visualization
3. After the last visualization, add a new section discussing about the saturation problem.
